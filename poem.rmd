## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
'The wonder is I didn't see at once.  
I never noticed it from here before.  
I must be wonted to it--that's the reason.  
The little graveyard where my people are!  
So small the window frames the whole of it.  
   
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright â€”  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
